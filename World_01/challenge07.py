#Develop a program that reads a student's two grades,
#calculates and displays their average.

firstGrade = float(input('Enter the value of the first test grade:'))
secondGrade = float(input('Enter the value of the second test grade:'))

The value of the second grade is {secondGrade}\n \
The grade average is {(firstGrade+secondGrade)/2} points')
